<h3>General Information</h3>
<p>
I am a senior marketing student taking the TAM minor. I have been trying to tailor my degree so I can stand out in the digital marketing field. The TAM minor adds to the design and hard skills needed in this field. My favorite classes I have taken in the TAM program have been web and code as its easier for me to comprehend and enjoy the material. When not devoting all my energies to the time intensive projects of the TAM program, I enjoy backpacking, cooking, and of course binge watching netflix.   
</p>
<h3>Class Goals</h3>
<p>
I have currently only taken the web and code classes so I have a relatively fair grasp on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (as much as someone can understand javascript). These classes have been my only exposure to web technologies and coding so consider me a blank canvas for basically everything my previous classes haven't specifically covered. The one major exception to this is Google Analytics. I have both taken a digital marketing class and received a certificate from Google on their Anlytics program.  I am looking forward to learning more about Wordpress as this is the website developer that many businesses use and will thus be the most useful in my future career.
